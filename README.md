# Multiplication-approximator
It appoximates the value of a multiplication between two numbers(can be decimals) with a 1.62% average relative difference.

There are two modes:
Random:
-The computer selects two decimal numbers from 0.1 - 99.9
Manual:
-You have to enter the numbers(it is recomended that the numbers are smaller than 100)

To access the modes you can type: "R" for random mode or "M" for the manual mode

This was done for practice.
